          Sammy decided to put his bags on the bed and cover them with the
          blanket to make them look as if he is still there while he is under
          the bed
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly he hears the door of the room widely open and the Giant's
          shadow standing with a big axe .
        </p>
        <p>
          He got close to the bed and hit it with the axe as strong as possible
          and got out of the room laughing saying "Great Breakfast tomorrow
          morning !"
        </p>

      <div class="chap p2">
        <h1 class="title">SUPERPOWERS?</h1>
        <p>
          The next morning the Giant enters the room and gets surprised by the
          untouched Sammy at all . So Sammy greeted the Giant and asked him if
          he could make him any breakfast !
        </p>
        <p>
          The Giant agreed but in his mind he's thinking of Sammy as a human who
          has super powers and decided to poison the soup that Sammy will eat!
        </p>

      <div class="chap p3">
        <h1 class="title">Soup Serving</h1>
        <p class="soup">
          The Giant prepared for Sammy the <i>poisoned soup</i> and told him to
          come and eat it .

          Sami now knew the intentions of the Giant but do you know ???
