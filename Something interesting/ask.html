        <p>
          Sammy hid his panic and asked the giant if he had a free bed which he
          can sleep on for the night . Sammy was impressed by the giant's
          welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          He showed him the room which had a small bed relatively to the giant's
          size which made Sammy anxious.
        </p>

      <div class="chap p2">
        <h2 class="title">The Anxiety</h2>
        <p>
          Sammy turned off the light to sleep but was very afraid of the Giant
          not knowing his real intentions which seemed too nice to be true!
        </p>
        <p>
          So he could'nt cope with his doubts so he started of thinking about
          hiding in the room like under the bed.
