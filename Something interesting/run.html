          Sammy didn't even introduce him self he ran as fast as the wind
          seeking to save his life and not being the giant's dinner !
        </p>
        <p>
          Sammy began to feel the pain in his legs , as well as doubt filled his
          mind about the intentions of the giant "did he want to do me any
          harm?". Sammy's body as well as mind needed some rest so he lit a
          campfire to get warmer . He spent the night around the camp thinking
          it's not such a lucky day is it ?
        </p>

      <div class="chap p2">
        <h2 class="title">The Sun Rise</h2>
        <p>The sun came back which gave Sammy a sense of hope !</p>
        <p>
          He felt a sore in his throat and came to his senses that he is thirsty
          <strong>a lot</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
          He headed forward where he reached a pond and thoughts of drinking
          from it took place in his mind.
