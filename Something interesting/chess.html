        <p>
          Sammy finished the soup well the Giant thought like this at least.The
          Giant got confused :"how did he not die from the strongest poison in
          this village?".
        </p>
        <p>
          He got scared from Sammy and thought maybe the posion didn't work not
          Sammy got superpowers
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="chap p2">
        <h1 class="title">The Poison is working</h1>
        <p>
          The Giant got interested so he tasted the soup and after couple of
          minutes Sammy heard a huge thud and saw the Giant laying down on the
          floor with a spoon in his hand .
        </p>
        <p>
          Sammy realized the soup was poisoned so he thanked his intuition and
          decided to continue this terrible trip and end it for good
        </p>
        <p>
          He headed forward , on his way he stumbled across a road which has 2
          paths.
