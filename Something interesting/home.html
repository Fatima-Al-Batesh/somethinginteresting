        <h2 class="title">The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          Sami , a poor kid which has no parents living in a village turned 16.
          He decided that he needs to move out of this village since he can't
          see a worthy future here!
        </p>
        <p>
          He started packing and preparing for his long and hopefully great and
          non-problematic trip!
        </p>
        <p>
          He decided to head towards a forest since tails where told in his
          village that behind this forest miracles happened!

        <h2 class="title">The Trip</h2>
        <p>
          It was a sunny day , Samy decided to start his trip at this day since
          he felt lucky as soon as he woke up !
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything was going right , Samy did really believe it's his lucky
          day
        </p>
        <p>
          Night came up , darkness nothing can be seen except a small house
          which Samy thought he can rest in by asking help from the habitants.
        </p>
        <p>
          He approached the small house and it was very creepy yet very wierd
          looking , so he thought to himself : 'let's knock on the door and give
          it a try!'.As he knocked , the door went wide open and a big figure
          appeared and after seconds Samy realized the habitant is a
          <strong>Giant</strong>!
